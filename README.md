# Task 2: Model Building and Training

This section focuses on building and training machine learning models to detect fraud in e-commerce and credit card transactions.  It covers data preparation, model selection, training, evaluation, and MLOps steps for experiment tracking and versioning.

## 1. Data Preparation

### 1.1. Feature and Target Separation

*   **Objective:** Isolate the features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable - 'Class' for creditcard.csv and 'class' for Fraud_Data.csv).
*   **Implementation:**  (Implementation details would go here. See the previous complete answer for example code.)
*   **Explanation:**  We separate the features (all columns except 'Class'/'class') into `X_credit` and `X_fraud`, and the target variables ('Class'/'class') into `y_credit` and `y_fraud` respectively.

### 1.2. Train-Test Split

*   **Objective:** Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.
*   **Implementation:** 
*   **Explanation:**  We use `train_test_split` from scikit-learn to split the data.  `test_size=0.2` means 20% of the data is used for testing, and `random_state=42` ensures reproducibility.

## 2. Model Selection

We will evaluate and compare the performance of several models, including:

*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear model suitable for binary classification.
*   **Decision Tree:** A tree-based model that makes decisions based on feature values.
*   **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
*   **Gradient Boosting:** Another ensemble method that combines weak learners to create a strong model.  Examples include XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
*   **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** A feedforward neural network.
*   **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**  Typically used for image data but can be adapted for time-series or sequence data (if the data is preprocessed accordingly).
*   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** Suitable for sequential data, like transaction history.
*   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** A type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem and is good at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data.

## 3. Model Training and Evaluation

*   **Objective:** Train and evaluate the selected models on both the credit card and fraud datasets.
*   **Implementation:** (Implementation details would go here. See the previous complete answer for example code, running and evaluating each model).
*   **Explanation:** (Explanation of the implementation, including the model training, prediction, and evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and AUC).

## 4. MLOps Steps

### 4.1. Versioning and Experiment Tracking

*   **Objective:** Track experiments, log parameters, metrics, and version models for reproducibility and comparison.  This uses tools like MLflow.
*   **Implementation:** (Implementation details would go here. See the previous complete answer for example code demonstrating MLflow integration).
*   **Explanation:** (Explanation of the MLflow implementation, including how to start runs, log parameters, metrics, and models.)

### 4.2. Model Comparison using MLflow

After running multiple experiments with different models and hyperparameters, we can use the MLflow UI to compare their performance.

*   **Accessing the MLflow UI:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you ran your MLflow experiments, and run `mlflow ui`.  This will start the MLflow UI in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:5000`).

*   **Comparing Runs:**
    1.  In the MLflow UI, select the "Runs" tab.
    2.  Select the runs you want to compare by checking the boxes next to their names.
    3.  Click the "Compare" button.

*   **Visualization and Analysis:** MLflow provides a table and plots to visualize the differences between the selected runs.  You can compare metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC), parameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength), and other relevant information.

    **[Capture of MLflow UI showing comparison of different model metrics across different models and parameters.  Highlighting key metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, AUC, and training time.

    *   **Note:**  This screenshot should show a clear comparison table highlighting the best-performing model based on the chosen metrics. For example, it might show that Random Forest had the highest F1-score and AUC, indicating better overall performance in fraud detection compared to Logistic Regression or Decision Tree. This will allow for good model selection.

*   **Model Selection Rationale:** Based on the MLflow comparison, the [Model Name] model was selected due to its [Reasons for Selection - e.g., high F1-score and AUC].

## 5. Considerations for Imbalanced Datasets

Fraud datasets are typically highly imbalanced (far fewer fraud cases than legitimate transactions). This can significantly impact model performance. Here are some strategies to address this:

*   **Resampling Techniques:**
    *   **Oversampling:**  Increase the number of minority class samples (e.g., using SMOTE).
    *   **Undersampling:**  Decrease the number of majority class samples.
*   **Cost-Sensitive Learning:**  Assign higher costs to misclassifying fraud cases.  Many models (like Logistic Regression) have parameters to adjust class weights.
*   **Anomaly Detection Techniques:**  Consider using anomaly detection algorithms, which are designed to identify rare events. Examples include Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Focus on metrics that are less sensitive to class imbalance, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve).

## 6. Next Steps

After training and evaluating the models, the next steps would involve:

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
*   **Model Explainability:** (Task 3) Use SHAP and LIME to understand the model's predictions.
*   **Model Deployment:** (Task 4) Deploy the selected model as an API using Flask and Docker.
*   **Dashboard Development:** (Task 5) Create an interactive dashboard using Flask and Dash to visualize fraud insights.
