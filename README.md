# Task 5 - Build a Dashboard with Flask and Dash

## Overview

Create an interactive dashboard using Dash for visualizing fraud insights from your data. The Flask backend will serve data from the datasets, while Dash will be used to visualize insights.

### Steps

1. Add a Flask Endpoint to read fraud data from a CSV file and serve summary statistics and fraud trends through API endpoints.

2. Use Dash to handle the frontend visualizations.

3. Dashboard Insights:

+ Display total transactions, fraud cases, and fraud percentages in summary boxes.

+ Display a line chart showing the number of detected fraud cases over time using Flask backend data.

+ Analyze where fraud is occurring geographically.

Show a bar chart comparing the number of fraud cases across different devices and browsers.
#Task 4 - Model Deployment and API Development

**Setting Up the Flask API**

**Create the Flask Application**

1. Create a new directory for your project:

`kdir fraud_detection_api && cd fraud_detection_api`

2. Create a Python script serve_model.py to serve the model using Flask.

3. Create a requirements.txt file to list dependencies.

**API Development**

Define API Endpoints.

Test the API using tools like Postman or curl.
# Model Explainability for Fraud Detection

## Task 3: Model Explainability

Model explainability is a critical aspect of machine learning, especially in sensitive applications like fraud detection. This repository demonstrates the use of SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to interpret machine learning models for fraud detection.

In this task, we use SHAP and LIME to interpret and explain the models we have built for fraud detection, helping to understand the predictions and trust the results.

## SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations)

SHAP is a unified measure of feature importance that helps explain the contribution of each feature to the prediction of a model.
The SHAP explanation framework provides several ways to visualize the impact of features on model predictions:
1. SHAP Summary Plot
The Summary Plot provides an overview of the most important features across the dataset, helping you identify which features contribute the most to the model's predictions.
2. SHAP Force Plot
The Force Plot visualizes the contribution of features for a single prediction, allowing you to see how individual features push the model output in one direction or another.
3. SHAP Dependence Plot
The Dependence Plot shows the relationship between a single feature and the model output, providing insight into how a feature's value affects the prediction.
### Installing SHAP

To install SHAP, use the following command:

```bash
pip install shap
```
## LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)
LIME is used to explain individual predictions by approximating the model locally with an interpretable model. It provides insights into which features contribute most to the model's prediction for a single instance.

Installing LIME
To install LIME, use the following command:

```bash
pip install lime
```

LIME creates feature importance plots by generating an interpretable model locally around a specific prediction. Here's how you can use LIME:

1. LIME Feature Importance Plot
The Feature Importance Plot shows the most influential features for a specific prediction, helping to understand why a particular prediction was made.
## Conclusion
Model explainability using SHAP and LIME helps in building trust in machine learning models, especially when deployed in critical applications like fraud detection. By understanding which features contribute to predictions, users can gain more insights into model behavior and improve its performance if necessary.

### Key Features:
- **SHAP**: Explains model predictions by calculating feature importance across the entire dataset.
- **LIME**: Explains individual predictions using locally interpretable models.

# Task 2: Model Building and Training

This section focuses on building and training machine learning models to detect fraud in e-commerce and credit card transactions.  It covers data preparation, model selection, training, evaluation, and MLOps steps for experiment tracking and versioning.

## 1. Data Preparation

### 1.1. Feature and Target Separation

*   **Objective:** Isolate the features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable - 'Class' for creditcard.csv and 'class' for Fraud_Data.csv).
*   **Implementation:**  (Implementation details would go here. See the previous complete answer for example code.)
*   **Explanation:**  We separate the features (all columns except 'Class'/'class') into `X_credit` and `X_fraud`, and the target variables ('Class'/'class') into `y_credit` and `y_fraud` respectively.

### 1.2. Train-Test Split

*   **Objective:** Divide the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the testing set is used to evaluate its performance on unseen data.
*   **Implementation:** 
*   **Explanation:**  We use `train_test_split` from scikit-learn to split the data.  `test_size=0.2` means 20% of the data is used for testing, and `random_state=42` ensures reproducibility.

## 2. Model Selection

We will evaluate and compare the performance of several models, including:

*   **Logistic Regression:** A linear model suitable for binary classification.
*   **Decision Tree:** A tree-based model that makes decisions based on feature values.
*   **Random Forest:** An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting.
*   **Gradient Boosting:** Another ensemble method that combines weak learners to create a strong model.  Examples include XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
*   **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP):** A feedforward neural network.
*   **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**  Typically used for image data but can be adapted for time-series or sequence data (if the data is preprocessed accordingly).
*   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** Suitable for sequential data, like transaction history.
*   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** A type of RNN that addresses the vanishing gradient problem and is good at capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data.

## 3. Model Training and Evaluation

*   **Objective:** Train and evaluate the selected models on both the credit card and fraud datasets.
*   **Implementation:** (Implementation details would go here. See the previous complete answer for example code, running and evaluating each model).
*   **Explanation:** (Explanation of the implementation, including the model training, prediction, and evaluation using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and AUC).

## 4. MLOps Steps

### 4.1. Versioning and Experiment Tracking

*   **Objective:** Track experiments, log parameters, metrics, and version models for reproducibility and comparison.  This uses tools like MLflow.
*   **Implementation:** (Implementation details would go here. See the previous complete answer for example code demonstrating MLflow integration).
*   **Explanation:** (Explanation of the MLflow implementation, including how to start runs, log parameters, metrics, and models.)

### 4.2. Model Comparison using MLflow

After running multiple experiments with different models and hyperparameters, we can use the MLflow UI to compare their performance.

*   **Accessing the MLflow UI:** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you ran your MLflow experiments, and run `mlflow ui`.  This will start the MLflow UI in your web browser (usually at `http://localhost:5000`).

*   **Comparing Runs:**
    1.  In the MLflow UI, select the "Runs" tab.
    2.  Select the runs you want to compare by checking the boxes next to their names.
    3.  Click the "Compare" button.

*   **Visualization and Analysis:** MLflow provides a table and plots to visualize the differences between the selected runs.  You can compare metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, AUC), parameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength), and other relevant information.

    **[Capture of MLflow UI showing comparison of different model metrics across different models and parameters.  Highlighting key metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, AUC, and training time.  Indicate the best-performing model based on the chosen criteria. The capture should also include column showing the source file location and the date of the model.]**
![MLflow UI Model Comparison](ScreenShoots/mlflow/)
    

    *   **Note:**  This screenshot should show a clear comparison table highlighting the best-performing model based on the chosen metrics. For example, it might show that Random Forest had the highest F1-score and AUC, indicating better overall performance in fraud detection compared to Logistic Regression or Decision Tree. This will allow for good model selection.

*   **Model Selection Rationale:** Based on the MLflow comparison, the [Model Name] model was selected due to its [Reasons for Selection - e.g., high F1-score and AUC].

## 5. Considerations for Imbalanced Datasets

Fraud datasets are typically highly imbalanced (far fewer fraud cases than legitimate transactions). This can significantly impact model performance. Here are some strategies to address this:

*   **Resampling Techniques:**
    *   **Oversampling:**  Increase the number of minority class samples (e.g., using SMOTE).
    *   **Undersampling:**  Decrease the number of majority class samples.
*   **Cost-Sensitive Learning:**  Assign higher costs to misclassifying fraud cases.  Many models (like Logistic Regression) have parameters to adjust class weights.
*   **Anomaly Detection Techniques:**  Consider using anomaly detection algorithms, which are designed to identify rare events. Examples include Isolation Forest and One-Class SVM.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Focus on metrics that are less sensitive to class imbalance, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve).

## 6. Next Steps

After training and evaluating the models, the next steps would involve:

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
*   **Model Explainability:** (Task 3) Use SHAP and LIME to understand the model's predictions.
*   **Model Deployment:** (Task 4) Deploy the selected model as an API using Flask and Docker.
*   **Dashboard Development:** (Task 5) Create an interactive dashboard using Flask and Dash to visualize fraud insights.
