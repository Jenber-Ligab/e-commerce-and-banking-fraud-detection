# 10 Academy: Artificial Intelligence Mastery - Fraud Detection Project

**Challenge Duration:** February 5, 2025 - February 18, 2025

## Overview

This project focuses on developing and implementing advanced fraud detection models for e-commerce and bank credit card transactions.  As a data scientist at Adey Innovations Inc., the goal is to leverage machine learning, geolocation analysis, and transaction pattern recognition to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of fraud detection.  Success in this project will lead to reduced financial losses, enhanced customer trust, and more efficient real-time monitoring for Adey Innovations Inc.'s clients.

## Business Need

Fraud detection is a critical concern for e-commerce and banking industries.  Accurate and robust fraud detection systems are essential for:

*   **Preventing Financial Losses:** Minimizing losses due to fraudulent transactions.
*   **Building Customer Trust:** Maintaining customer confidence in the security of transactions.
*   **Efficient Monitoring:** Enabling real-time detection and reporting of suspicious activities.
*   **Risk Reduction:** Proactively identifying and mitigating potential risks associated with fraud.

By improving fraud detection capabilities, Adey Innovations Inc. can provide significant value to its clients, enhancing the security and reliability of their financial systems.

## Data and Features

This project utilizes three datasets:

1.  **Fraud_Data.csv:**  Contains e-commerce transaction data designed for identifying fraudulent activities.

    *   `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.
    *   `signup_time`: Timestamp of user signup.
    *   `purchase_time`: Timestamp of purchase.
    *   `purchase_value`: Value of the purchase (USD).
    *   `device_id`: Unique identifier for the device used.
    *   `source`: Source of traffic (e.g., SEO, Ads).
    *   `browser`: Browser used for the transaction.
    *   `sex`: User's gender (M/F).
    *   `age`: User's age.
    *   `ip_address`: IP address of the transaction.
    *   `class`: Target variable (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Non-fraudulent).

2.  **IpAddress_to_Country.csv:**  Maps IP addresses to countries.

    *   `lower_bound_ip_address`: Lower bound of the IP address range.
    *   `upper_bound_ip_address`: Upper bound of the IP address range.
    *   `country`: Country corresponding to the IP address range.

3.  **creditcard.csv:**  Contains bank transaction data for fraud detection analysis.

    *   `Time`: Seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
    *   `V1` to `V28`: Anonymized features (PCA components).
    *   `Amount`: Transaction amount (USD).
    *   `Class`: Target variable (1 = Fraudulent, 0 = Non-fraudulent).

## Project Tasks

### Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing

This task involves preparing the datasets for model training.  The following steps will be performed:

1.  **Handle Missing Values:**
    *   Impute missing values using appropriate methods (e.g., mean, median, mode, or more advanced techniques).
    *   Alternatively, drop rows or columns with excessive missing values.

2.  **Data Cleaning:**
    *   Remove duplicate entries to avoid data redundancy.
    *   Ensure correct data types for each column.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   **Univariate Analysis:** Analyze individual features to understand their distribution and characteristics (e.g., histograms, boxplots, summary statistics).
    *   **Bivariate Analysis:** Explore relationships between features and the target variable to identify potential predictors (e.g., scatter plots, correlation matrices).

4.  **Merge Datasets for Geolocation Analysis:**
    *   Convert IP addresses to integer format for efficient comparison.
    *   Merge `Fraud_Data.csv` with `IpAddress_to_Country.csv` based on IP address ranges to add country information.

5.  **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Fraud_Data.csv:**
        *   Calculate transaction frequency and velocity (e.g., number of transactions per user in a given time period).
        *   Create time-based features:
            *   `hour_of_day`: Hour of the day the transaction occurred.
            *   `day_of_week`: Day of the week the transaction occurred.

6.  **Normalization and Scaling:**
    *   Apply appropriate scaling techniques (e.g., StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) to numerical features to ensure they have a similar range and prevent features with larger values from dominating the model.

7.  **Encode Categorical Features:**
    *   Convert categorical features into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding for compatibility with machine learning models.
